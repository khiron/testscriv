title Cogent 3 Future

section Cogent3
TBA 
: Interconversion of `cogent3` and `IQ-TREE` primary data types 
: Extend `cogent3` model grammar to include Lie-Markov models. Update documentation and make release. (origin CZ grant)
: Implement `cogent3` hooks for phylogeny reconstruction (invoking the `iqtree` extension), phylogeny 23 / 48 visualisation (invoking the `ete3` extension) and sequence annotation (invoking the SQLite annotation extension).
